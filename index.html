      Adds migration methods to manage constraints in PostgreSQL.
    </div>

<div class="wikistyle">
<p>
If you&#8217;re on PostgreSQL and see the importance of data-layer
constraints - this gem/plugin is for you. It integrates constraints into
PostgreSQL adapter so you can add/remove them in your migrations. You get
two simple methods for adding/removing constraints, as well as a pack of
pre-made constraints.
</p>
<h2>Install</h2>

<p>
As a gem
</p>
<pre>
  gem install maxim-sexy_pg_constraints --source http://gems.github.com
</pre>
<p>
or as a plugin
</p>
<pre>
  script/plugin install git://github.com/maxim/sexy_pg_constraints.git
</pre>
<p>
One more thing. Make sure that in your environment.rb file you have the
following line uncommented.
</p>

<pre>
  config.active_record.schema_format = :sql
</pre>
<p>
Otherwise your test database will not have these constraints replicated.
</p>
<h2>Usage</h2>
<h3>Single-column constraints</h3>
<p>
Say you have a table &quot;books&quot; and you want your Postgres DB to
ensure that their title is not-blank, alphanumeric, and its length is
between 3 and 50 chars. You also want to make sure that their isbn is
unique. In addition you want to blacklist a few isbn numbers from ever
being in your database. You can tell all that to your Postgres in no time.
Generate a migration and write the following.
</p>

<pre>
  class AddConstraintsToBooks &lt; ActiveRecord::Migration
    def self.up
      constrain :books do |t|
        t.title :not_blank =&gt; true, :alphanumeric =&gt; true, :length_within =&gt; 3..50
        t.isbn :unique =&gt; true, :blacklist =&gt; %w(badbook1 badbook2)
      end
    end

    def self.down
      deconstrain :books do |t|
        t.title :not_blank, :alphanumeric, :length_within
        t.isbn :unique, :blacklist
      end
    end
  end
</pre>
<p>

This will add all the necessary constraints to the database on the next
migration, and remove them on rollback.
</p>
<p>
There&#8217;s also a syntax for when you don&#8217;t need to work with
multiple columns at once.
</p>
<pre>
  constrain :books, :title, :not_blank =&gt; true, :length_within =&gt; 3..50
</pre>
<p>
The above line works exactly the same as this block

</p>
<pre>
  constrain :books do |t|
    t.title :not_blank =&gt; true, :length_within =&gt; 3..50
  end
</pre>
<p>
Same applies to deconstrain.
</p>
<h3>Multi-column constraints</h3>
<p>
Say you have the same table &quot;books&quot; only now you want to tell
your Postgres to make sure that you should never have the same title +
author_id combination. It means that you want to apply uniqueness to two
columns, not just one. There is a special syntax for working with
multicolumn constraints.

</p>
<pre>
  class AddConstraintsToBooks &lt; ActiveRecord::Migration
    def self.up
      constrain :books do |t|
        t[:title, :author_id].all :unique =&gt; true # Notice how multiple columns are listed in brackets.
      end
    end

    def self.down
      deconstrain :books do |t|
        t[:title, :author_id].all :unique
      end
    end
  end
</pre>
<p>
It&#8217;s important to note that you shouldn&#8217;t mix multicolumn
constraints with regular ones in one line. This may cause unexpected
behavior.
</p>
<h3>Foreign key constrants</h3>
<p>

In our table &quot;books&quot; we have column &quot;author_id&quot; which
should reference the &quot;id&quot; column in the &quot;authors&quot;
table. Here&#8217;s the very simple syntax for setting up foreign key
constraint that will tell Postgres to enforce this relationship.
</p>
<pre>
  class AddConstraintsToBooks &lt; ActiveRecord::Migration
    def self.up
      constrain :books do |t|
        t.author_id :reference =&gt; {:authors =&gt; :id, :on_delete =&gt; :cascade}
      end
    end

    def self.down
      deconstrain :books do |t|
        t.author_id :reference
      end
    end
  end

</pre>
<p>
In this example we&#8217;re telling Postgres to enforce the connection of
author_id to the column &quot;id&quot; in table &quot;authors&quot;.
However, we&#8217;re also telling it to cascade on delete. This means that
when an author is deleted - every book that referred to that author will be
deleted as well.
</p>
<h2>Available constraints</h2>
<p>
Below is the list of constraints available and tested so far.
</p>

<ul>
<li>whitelist

</li>
<li>blacklist

</li>
<li>not_blank

</li>
<li>within

</li>
<li>length_within

</li>
<li>email

</li>
<li>alphanumeric

</li>
<li>positive

</li>

<li>unique

</li>
<li>exact_length

</li>
<li>reference

</li>
<li>even

</li>
<li>odd

</li>
<li>format

</li>
</ul>
<h2>Extensibility</h2>
<p>
All constraints are located in the lib/constraints.rb. Extending this
module with more methods will automatically make constraints available in
migrations. All methods in the Constraints module are under module_function
directive. Each method is supposed to return a piece of SQL that is
inserted &quot;alter table foo add constraint bar #{RIGHT HERE};.&quot;

</p>
<h2>TODO</h2>
<ul>
<li>Create better API for adding constraints

</li>
</ul>
